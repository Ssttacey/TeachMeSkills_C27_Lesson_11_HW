Homework for the eleventh lesson

Task 1. 
The runner class stores a string of data. in a separate class we have several methods for working with data from this row. methods allow us to:
 * The first method displays the first two blocks of 4 digits on the screen on one line.
 * The second method displays the document number, but replaces blocks of three letters with ***.
 * The third method displays only one letter of the document number in lowercase.
 * The fourth method displays the letters from the document number in uppercase (using the StringBuilder class).
 * The fifth method checks whether the document number contains the sequence "abc" .
 * The sixth method checks whether the document number begins with the sequence 555.
 * The seventh method checks whether the document number ends with the sequence 1a2b.

Task 2.
The runner class contains a line with text information. in another class there is a method that takes this same string as input and allows, using an array and a for loop, to display the longest and shortest word from the string given to us

Task 3.
The runner class contains a string with text information. in another class there is a method that takes the same string as input, a substring is created in the method, which allows us to display a new string in which each letter from the original string is duplicated several times.
